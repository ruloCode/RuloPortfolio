## Overview

This project is an interactive virtual reality (VR) demo built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). It simulates a natural landscape with a day/night cycle, ambient sounds, and 3D models. It's ideal for learning the basics of web VR and how to integrate local assets (images, audio, and 3D models).

## Features

- **Day/Night Cycle**: The environment automatically transitions between day and night, with different lighting, backgrounds, and ambient sounds.
- **Immersive Landscape**: Includes a spherical skybox, grass-textured ground, and a 3D tree.
- **Ambient Audio**: Different sounds for day and night.
- **Virtual Clock**: Time advances quickly (1 real second = 1 virtual minute).
- **VR Controls**: Move with WASD keys and look around with the mouse.

## How to Try It

1. Open the project online: [VR Landscape Demo](https://vr-a-frame-example.vercel.app/)
2. Explore the VR environment! Move with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` and look around with your mouse.
