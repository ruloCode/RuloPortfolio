## 🚀 Project Overview

**Bambu Coliving** is a next-gen web platform built for a modern coliving startup in Bogotá. From UX/UI design to front-end architecture, I led the **full-stack development** of this project, turning a business idea into a high-performing digital product with global potential.

The platform was designed to attract digital nomads, students, and professionals looking for more than just a place to stay — a full community experience. Built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and performance-first principles, Bambu delivers a smooth, fast, and scalable experience across all devices.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ **End-to-end execution**: from Figma wireframes to production deployment  
- ✅ **Real-world impact**: solving actual housing needs for remote workers  
- ✅ **Business-oriented**: designed to convert, retain and build community trust  
- ✅ **Scalable architecture**: ready to integrate international payments and app extensions  

## 🔍 Key Features

### **Conversion-Focused UX**
- Real-time booking system with smart filters by dates and guests
- Fully responsive layout with optimized navigation
- Modern visual language aligned with branding strategy

### **Modular Room Catalog**
- Room types with dynamic pricing, gallery, and specs
- Easy-to-update structure for future expansion
- SEO-ready URLs and semantic markup

### **Community-Driven Content**
- Resident testimonials and digital nomad stories
- Trust-building social proof and curated content
- Community-focused design for engagement and retention

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)** – SSR, API routes, dynamic metadata
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for consistency and speed
- **Core Web Vitals** – Optimized performance for SEO and UX
- **On-page SEO** – Clean structure, meta tags, accessibility


## 🧑‍💻 Developer Highlights

As the technical and product lead, I:

- **Crafted a fully responsive front-end** with pixel-perfect UI and smooth UX
- **Optimized SEO and performance**, improving load times and Google indexing
- **Set up a scalable codebase** for future growth (internationalization, payment systems)
- **Translated business goals into code**, aligning product features with market needs

## 📊 Impact & Outcomes

- +80% of early visitors completed room exploration  
- Increased trust via localized testimonials and visual storytelling  
- Positioned Bambu as a **top-tier coliving option** in Bogotá’s growing remote work scene
